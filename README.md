# todo_finder
program to find and list TODOs commented in python files

If you discovered this repo because you're looking for a good tool to track issues and tasks inside your coding projects,
this is probably not the right place to look.
This code is old, inelegant, and derelict - I've never improved on it and have no intention to.
There are many, many tools out there better suited to the task of helping one track and work on problems and missing features in their code.
